## Experience

### Freelance web and applications Developer
**Varied, September 2008 - Present.** Since a young age I have been interested in working with web and mobile technologies. This led me into the field of freelance development. I have worked with a range of clients all over the world to bring them the solution that is right for them.
I mainly work with HTML5, jQuery, Python, PHP and Ruby. I chose these languages as they are relatively stable and allow me to build a library of classes that I can re-use and develop further and put my software at the forefront of technology.
As a part of my freelance development I hosted the majority of my clients on my own RHEL Based KVM Virtual Hosting Platform. This used a collection of HP DL380G8 Servers and a RAID 6 Array of 10 disks to store data. My network was co-located with OVH in France.



### Senior Software Developer
**Guest-Tek Interactive Entertainment LTD, Stirling, January 2014 - Present.** As a Senior Software Developer I worked with a Ruby on Rails based Purchase engine for hotel WiFi. This is a multi platform project that involves communicating from a cloud based infrastructure to a network device to confirm purchases and interface with the hotel Property Management System (PMS). I was involved in Back end and Front End Development in this project using Ruby, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and SOAP/XML Calls.

I was involved in a project to convert our existing network device to use commodity hardware. This network device was an embedded Linux Appliance using the ARMv4 architecture. The base Operating System used was BusyBox with a range of custom written Kernel Modules. These kernel modules allowed us to perform tasks such as Sub Vlan (Vlans within Vlans) routing between different areas in a property for example a printer on a Private vlan could be shared out among multiple vlans. The modules also allowed per mac bandwidth throttling and deep packet inspection.

I am also currently involved in a project where I take multicast mpeg streams and extract EPG Data from DVB-T and DVB-S broadcasts. This involves breaking down the streams frame by frame and extracting the EPG Information Table (EIT) and storing the program information in a postgresql database. This project uses C, Debian (Linux), libpq (Postgres SQL Library for C), libdvbpsi (C Library to aid in extracting EIT), Linux Threads and Semaphores.

I have also taken on a DevOps Role alongside Software Developer. In this role I am responsible for maintaining Linux Based office and production infrastructure for our TV System using Puppet, Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, KVM and oVirt/RHEV.


### Systems Administrator
**Xtraordinary Networks LTD., Edinburgh, Contract, January 2012 - August 2012.** As a Systems Administrator, in this devops role, I was responsible for maintaining a network of over 300 server supplied to customers. I worked mainly with XEN and KVM on CentOS 5 & 6 and RHEL 5 & 6 Based hosts.
During my time with the company I learned how to configure BGP sessions between our peers at LINX and maintain the network routes throughout the Juniper and Cisco based routers.
I developed a Ruby based Logical Volume backup system that is unique to the business in the way it backs up virtual machines. It first takes a snapshot and compares the blocks in the image to the image on file. It then synchronizes the differences into a new image stored on a remote ZFS based storage cluster on Debian based Host servers using a custom native kernel module developed by myself. Once the snapshot synchronized successfully it could then be restored to the virtual machine using the reverse of the backup process.

## About Me
Capable and confident with 9+ years IT experience, OSX, Windows 20xx, Linux since kernel 2.4, MCDST, LPIC 3 and foreign/programming languages, strong focus on customer service and technical ability. Have written course material widely used in infosec training in many universities across the United States.

In my spare time my main interests are Software Development and Music. I have an in-depth experience in a Unix / Linux environment and C Software Development, expertise in maximizing memory usage of the Linux kernel and various C based applications. I am extremely musical and play the guitar, bass, drums, keyboard/piano, violin and cello. 
I am a competent Developer and Systems Administrator who takes pride in the ability to increase system security and reliability. I also enjoy volunteering with the Fedora Project to package applications for fedora releases and Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL). 
I recently found enjoyment working with mobile platforms and developed the Bash 
Quick Reference and a Helmholtz Calculator (iHelmholtz) that are both available in the 
iPhone app store. These apps are developed using the Cocoa Touch framework and Objective-C.
